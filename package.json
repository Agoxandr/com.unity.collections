    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Added a new `GetUnsafeReadOnlyPtr` method to `DataStreamReader`. This can be used as an escape hatch if access to the underlying buffer of the stream reader is required.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* A previous release did not allow `unsafeList.RemoveRange(unsafeList.Length, 0)` anymore, which could cause failures in many common algorithms. This has been fixed.\n* Made `SortJob.SegmentSort`, and `SortJob.SegmentSortMerge` public to allow generic job type registration.\n* `UnsafeList.RemoveAtSwapBack` could read invalid memory when the last element of the list is removed\n* Data elements in FixedList<T, U> now respect natural alignment for the type T"
